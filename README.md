# OR Scheduling System Redesign  
## Using a Human-Centered Design Approach

---

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on redesigning an **Operating Room (OR) scheduling system** using a **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** approach. The goal was to address common issues such as inefficiency, lack of transparency, last-minute changes, and perceived unfairness in OR scheduling, while keeping the needs of administrators and clinical staff at the center of the solution.

Rather than jumping straight to automation, this project emphasizes **understanding users, framing the right problem, and designing solutions that feel fair, clear, and usable** in a hospital environment.

## Understanding the Problem
When our team began this project, it quickly became clear that OR scheduling was a major pain point. The process was time-consuming, relied heavily on manual coordination, and caused confusion for both staff and administrators.

**Key challenges identified:**
- Manual scheduling through spreadsheets and emails  
- Frequent last-minute changes and conflicts  
- Staff often receiving schedules very late  
- Administrators spending hours on revisions  
- Repeated messages from staff to confirm or swap shifts  

Our observations aligned with existing research. Ala et al. (2022) note that many scheduling systems still rely on manual processes and underutilize data, leading to inefficiency and frustration. Uhde et al. (2020) emphasize that **fairness and transparency** are critical for trust and acceptance of scheduling systems. This reinforced the idea that any redesign needed to go beyond automation and focus on user trust.

##  Framing the Design Challenge
Using IDEO’s **Frame Your Design Challenge** method, we refined our focus and defined the following guiding question:

> **How might we design a simple and data-smart scheduling system that reduces confusion, saves time, and helps everyone feel more in control of their schedules?**

In the context of a hospital setting, we defined success as:
- Fewer scheduling conflicts  
- Reduced administrative workload  
- Clear and timely communication  
- Improved trust in the scheduling process  

This framing helped us focus our ideas toward solutions that could realistically be prototyped and tested.

##  Brainstorming Ideas
Next, we applied IDEO’s **Brainstorm New Ideas** method to generate solutions without judgment. Prompts used during brainstorming included:
- What if staff could swap shifts with one click?
- What if AI could predict busy OR days?
- What if OR assignments were automated based on surgery type or required medical devices?

After grouping similar ideas and voting, we selected three concepts to move forward with:

### Selected Concepts
- **Smart Scheduler**  
  A system that suggests schedules using historical data such as surgery type, expected duration, staffing needs, and resource availability.

- **One-Click Swap**  
  A digital feature that allows staff to exchange shifts quickly and transparently without long email chains.

- **Fairness Dashboard**  
  A visual dashboard showing how shifts are distributed to ensure transparency and promote trust.

##  Testing Ideas with the Theory of Change
We used a **Theory of Change** framework to evaluate whether our ideas could realistically lead to meaningful outcomes.

### Long-Term Impact
- Faster, fairer, and more user-friendly OR scheduling

### Short-Term Outcomes
- Reduced scheduling conflicts  
- Faster schedule creation and updates  

### Medium-Term Outcomes
- Higher staff satisfaction  
- More balanced and equitable workloads  

### Key Activities
- Prototyping the smart scheduler  
- Piloting the one-click swap feature  
- Collecting user feedback and iterating  

### Assumptions
- Visibility into fairness increases trust (Uhde et al., 2020)  
- Data-driven automation reduces wasted time while still requiring human flexibility (Ala et al., 2022)

## From → To Transformation

| From | To |
|-----|----|
| Manual, time-consuming scheduling using spreadsheets and emails | Automated, data-supported scheduling that updates quickly |
| High administrative workload | Reduced workload for hospital managers |
| Uneven shift assignments and fairness complaints | Transparent and balanced scheduling |
| Limited visibility into OR and device assignments | Clear, accessible scheduling for ORs and medical devices |

##  Reflection & Key Learnings
This project showed us that design thinking is not just about making systems faster—it is about **understanding people**. Initially, we focused on efficiency, but through research and structured design methods, we learned that users value **clarity, fairness, and control** just as much.

We also learned the importance of **testing ideas early**, making assumptions explicit, and iterating rather than trying to build a perfect solution from the start. Overall, this project demonstrated how structured design frameworks—such as **Frame Your Design Challenge**, **Brainstorm New Ideas**, and **Theory of Change**—can transform everyday operational frustrations into meaningful improvement opportunities.
